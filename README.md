# Clone-UI
Tailwindcss UI, suitable for front-end frameworks Vue, React, Svelte, and also supports native HTML projects (in hot development 🔥)

## Why is it called Clone UI? 🤔
> Because I often use the git clone command XD

In fact, it is because it is the first time writing a UI library. It is estimated that there will be a large-scale reference (plagiarism) of other people's code, so it is also a new cloned UI. Maybe in future versions, it will gradually have its own style! 💪🏼

## Goal
Become a UI library that can be successfully used in projects and gain recognition!!

## Estimated plan
In the first version of development, I will directly use Vue to develop the UI library. If I were to develop using raw HTML and JavaScript, I would probably feel frustrated immediately! Because when I try to encapsulate many things myself, it never feels good enough. So I will start development with Vue and refer to excellent open-source libraries in the community such as Nuxt UI, Next UI, Element Plus for encapsulation ideas and API design.

### The following is reference UI library:

> [Nuxt UI](ui.nuxt.com) Nuxt team developed UI library, very easy to use when used with Nuxt! The design is also very simple, and the customization aspect is also great!
> 
> [Nuxt UI](nextui.org) A React UI library that I recently discovered, with a very nice design and comfortable animation effects for all components. Oh, they also developed a very practical tool for writing tailwindcss [tailwind-variants](https://github.com/nextui-org/tailwind-variants).
> 
> [Elemnt Plus](https://element-plus.org) A very practical and convenient set of component libraries in Vue, which is also very popular!

**Wish me smooth sailing and don't give up halfway! ✊🏼**
