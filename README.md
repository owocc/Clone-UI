Tailwindcss UI, suitable for front-end frameworks Vue, React, Svelte, and also supports native HTML projects (in hot development ðŸ”¥)

## Why is it called Clone UI?
> Because I often use the git clone command XD

In fact, it is because it is the first time writing a UI library. It is estimated that there will be a large-scale reference (plagiarism) of other people's code, so it is also a new cloned UI. Maybe in future versions, it will gradually have its own style!
